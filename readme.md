# GPT Wrapper

My own personal wrapper for GPT.  This is something I built several years ago. And is probably way out of date, but I wanted to get it into a repo so i don't forget about it.


## Setup

```sh
npm i
```
## Edit the config

In the example HTML file scroll to the bottom and change __network__ and __site__ to your values.

## Viewing the page

```sh
npm start
```

## Viewing the debug frame

```javascript
window.money.homepage.debug();
```

## Viewing the google console

```javascript
googletag.openConsole();
```
